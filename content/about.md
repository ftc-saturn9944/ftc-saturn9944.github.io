SATURN Robotics is a **FIRST Tech Challenge** robotics club operating out of
Mandarin High School in Jacksonville, Florida.  Started in 2016, our team has
helped local high-school students engage in STEM by designing, building, and
programming robots for competition.

On the team, students get hands-on experience building and programming robots,
and work as a team to accomplish goals.  This experience will not only help them
learn new things and pursue their interests, but will help their career path by
allowing them to develop practical skills and knowledge in STEM fields.
