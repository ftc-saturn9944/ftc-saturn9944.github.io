sponsorships provided after this will only appear on the next printing.

**Team Banner**
We do have a banner that we can display at State Championships if we attend.
The regular season competitions do not have enough space to put up a banner
without interfering with other teams so we do not bring it to those events.
If you want your logo to be on the banner we can coordinate with you should
we go to States since we will need to get a new banner printed.
